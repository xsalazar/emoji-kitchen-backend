# üßë‚Äçüç≥ Emoji Kitchen Backend

This repository holds both the Terraform infrastructure code as well as the simple Javascript application that runs inside the AWS Lambda function.

This application code is a basic API service that takes in a search query, finds the related emoji codepoints, and returns it to the frontend client.

The infrastructure supporting this backend application is a simple public API Gateway that forwards valid requests to the Lambda function.

This backend application is used to support the website [https://emojikitchen.dev](https://emojikitchen.dev) for quick and reliable search.
